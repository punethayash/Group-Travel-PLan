# Group-Travel-Plan
Anyone who has planned a trip for a group of people, or even for an individual, realizes that there are a lot of different inputs requires, such as what's everyone flight or train schedule should be, how many cars, or automobiles to be rented, which station or airport is nearest.
Many outputs must be considered, such as total cost, time spent waiting at airports, and time taken off work.
As the inputs can't be mapped with a simple formula, the problem of finding the best solution lends itself to optimization.

The code uses optimization methods like random searching, hill climbing, simulated annealing, and an unsupervised learning algo, Genetic Algorithms.

There are many ways this problem can be expanded. You might combine it with a weather search to optimize for combinations of prices and warm temperatures at potential destinations, or with a hotel search to find destinations with a reasonable combination of flight and hotel prices.
